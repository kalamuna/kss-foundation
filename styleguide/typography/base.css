/**
 * Base Typography
 *
 * Typography in Foundation 6 is meant to make your life easier by providing clean, attractive, simple default styles for all of the most basic typographical elements.

/**
 * Paragraphs
 *
 * This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are preset with a font size, line height and spacing to match the overall vertical rhythm. To show what a paragraph looks like this needs a little more content—so, did you know that there are storms occurring on Jupiter that are larger than the Earth? Pretty cool. Use the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags to denote text that should be displayed or read with emphasis. Browsers will bold and italicize the words, while screen readers will read them with emphasis.

/**
 * Header
 *
 * Foundation includes styles for all headings—they're balanced and sized along a modular scale.
 *
 * Markup:
 * <h1>h1. This is a very large header.</h1>
 * <h2>h2. This is a large header.</h2>
 * <h3>h3. This is a medium header.</h3>
 * <h4>h4. This is a moderate header.</h4>
 * <h5>h5. This is a small header.</h5>
 * <h6>h6. This is a tiny header.</h6>

 */

/**
 * Small Header Segments
 *
 * By inserting a `<small>` element into a header Foundation will scale the header font size down for an inline element, allowing you to use this for subtitles or other secondary header text.
 *
 * Markup:
 * <h3>Foundation for Sites <small>Version 6.5.0</small></h3>
 *
 * Styleguide typography.base.small-header

/**
 * Links
 *
 * Links are very standard, and the color is preset to the Foundation primary color. Learn more about Foundation's global colors.

 * Markup:
 * <p>Links are very standard, and the color is preset to the Foundation primary color. <a href="global.html">Learn more about Foundation's global colors.</a></p>

/**
 * Dividers
 *
 * Use dividers to define thematic breaks between paragraphs. To denote the end of one section of a page and the start of another, it's better to use the <section> tag.
 *
 * Markup:
 * <hr>
